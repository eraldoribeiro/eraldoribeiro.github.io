 abstract = {In this paper we investigate how texture recognition can be achieved
through the modal analysis of the pattern of peaks in the spectral
density function. We commence from a texture characterisation which is
based on the positions of peaks in the power spectrum. Our aim is to
use the modal structure of the pattern of peaks to perform texture
retrieval from an image data-base. We explore two different approaches
to the problem. First, we use a variant of the Shapiro and Brady,
method to perform recognition by comparing the modal structure of the
proximity matrix for peak cluster centres. Second, we perform latent
semantic indexing on vectors representing the polar distribution
of frequency peaks. We provide an experimental evaluation of these
two methods on a data-base of fabric and wrapping paper patterns.},
