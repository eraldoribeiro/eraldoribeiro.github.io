    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract" itemprop="text">Cuisine is a key cultural component in all societies. The motto we-are-what-we-eat is known to most people; recently it has even been argued that we-are-what-we-cook.

Our hypothesis is that recipes and the ingredients of a recipe can tell us the origin of the people who prepared it. This approach could be used to define cultures not bounded by country borders but by similarities on how people prepare their food. In a more practical way, the understanding of relations between recipes can be used by automated recommendation systems in restaurants, supermarkets or be made available as an application to mobile devices. Our approach is based on Network Science. We have created a network were nodes represent a particular recipe, and edges connecting the nodes are defined based on ingredients shared by the nodes.
